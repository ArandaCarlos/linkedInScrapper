The foundation of our philosophy is simple: The body is self- healing and self-regulating and the nervous system is the super highway the body uses to do just that. Doesn't it make sense to be proactive and not reactive in regard to maintaining the body's ability to self-regulate and self-heal? Of course it does. Everyone knows a symptom is the last sign, not the first sign that something is not right in the body. Just ask the individual who had a heart attack on the golf course or the person who bent over to pick up a newspaper and \"threw out their back\". Obviously, there are underlying causes to these conditions before a symptom presents itself. At Zimmerman Chiropractic we maintain that an optimally functioning spine and nervous system, coupled with good nutrition and exercise leads to optimal health and healing.\n\u2026\nshow more\nSee more"

The foundation of our philosophy is simple: The body is self- healing and self-regulating and the nervous system is the super highway the body uses to do just that. Doesn't it make sense to be proactive and not reactive in regard to maintaining the body's ability to self-regulate and self-heal? Of course it does. Everyone knows a symptom is the last sign, not the first sign that something is not right in the body. Just ask the individual who had a heart attack on the golf course or the person who bent over to pick up a newspaper and \"threw out their back\". Obviously, there are underlying causes to these conditions before a symptom presents itself. At Zimmerman Chiropractic we maintain that an optimally functioning spine and nervous system, coupled with good nutrition and exercise leads to optimal health and healing.\n\u2026\nshow more\nSee more"
